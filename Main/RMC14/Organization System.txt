A dewey decimal system esque system for naming forms and files, designed for consistency and immediate recognition of what the form is for.
Department Prefixes:


M = Medical
P = Military Police
C = Command/CIC
R = Requisitions
CL/WY = Corporate Liaison/Weston-Yamada (either or)
X = Auxiliary
S = Squad
E = Engineering
G = General/things that dont fit elsewhere


Secondary Prefixes are used for further specification within a department, IE bag tags for medical, denoting intel vs JTAC for aux, and OT vs MT for engineering.
Secondary Prefixes:


M-BT = Medical - Bag Tag (used to put on body/stasis bags)
X-F, X-I = Aux flight department, Aux Intel Department
S-A, S-B, S-C, S-D = Alpha, bravo, charlie squad etc.
E-O = Ordinance department of engi


Any additional prefixes are fine, if they are not super self explanatory add them here.


next up, actual numbers!
Forms are followed by 3 (4 if you prefer, doesn't matter) digit numbers. The first number actually means something, the rest are just to separate it from other forms.
Ideally similar forms are sequential in number (IE a weapon request form and a equipment request form would be 301 and 302)


0 = Forms intended for squad roles, department dependent. M-0xx forms would most likely be intended towards corpsmen, for instance.
1 = Deceased individuals, death reports, etc
2 = treatments/procedures, unlikely to be used much outside of medical and maybe MP
3 = Equipment/Gear requests or inventories, filling armory, etc
4 = Any sort of reports, audits, etc, that do not explicitly fit within other categories.
5 = Personnel, authorizing FOB deployment, promoting/demoting, warrants for MP, squad orders, etc.
6 = General paperwork, NDA's, contracts, affidavits of liability, all the peak bureaucracy things.
9 = Any other things that don't really fit into other categories. If there are enough similar forms in this, the normal list will be expanded to include it.


Examples of purely theoretical forms:
M-105 could denote a medical form recording the permanent death of a individual
E-503 could denote a form approving a MT to deploy to the FOB
S-A501 could denote squad orders for alpha
MP-443 could denote a MP incident report
